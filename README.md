"DESCRIPTION" : I created this Interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a responsive and engaging web experience. The HTML provides a clean, semantic structure with a central container that holds the quiz title, dynamically loaded question text, multiple choice options, score display, and navigation buttons like "Next" and "Restart." The CSS enhances the interface with a modern look, featuring a gradient background, centered layout using Flexbox, and card-style styling for the quiz box. Buttons are styled with hover effects and color transitions, with responsive behavior that ensures a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile screens. The JavaScript handles the core quiz functionality, including rendering questions and options from a predefined array, detecting user answers, providing instant feedback through color changes (green for correct, red for incorrect), and tracking the score. When a user selects an answer, all options are disabled to prevent multiple selections, and the correct one is highlighted. The app includes a "Next" button to move through the quiz and a "Restart Quiz" button that resets the score and reloads the first question, allowing the user to retake the quiz without refreshing the page. The logic is modular and clean, using event listeners, conditionals, and dynamic DOM manipulation. All features work together to make the quiz fully interactive, visually appealing, and easy to expand with more questions in the future. This project helped me apply and strengthen my skills in responsive web design, DOM traversal, and JavaScript interactivity, and it's a great example of how I can turn static content into an engaging web application.
